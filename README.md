# Description

This is a simple starter project using `create-react-app` & `electron` with `Typescript`. Great for a quick start, happy coding. :tada:

---

### Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode & launches electron<br />

Just like with `create-react-app` the page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
